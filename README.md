## SimFusion: SimCLRv2 for Image and Text Similarity

### Overview

SimFusion is an innovative project that leverages SimCLRv2 and similar techniques to measure similarity between both images and text. SimCLRv2, a powerful self-supervised learning method, is applied to create embeddings for both images and text, allowing for a unified approach to similarity measurement. This project provides a versatile and efficient solution for tasks that involve assessing similarity between diverse modalities.
